This project analyzes Cam Johnson’s 2025–26 season in Denver, focusing on whether his second-half offensive surge represents a sustained role adjustment or short-term variance. The analysis evaluates scoring efficiency, shot profile stability, rebounding trends, and role consistency following a significant usage reduction relative to his prior seasons.

The goal is to contextualize Johnson’s rebound within Denver’s offensive ecosystem and determine whether the production aligns with sustainable impact rather than a stretch of hot shooting.
