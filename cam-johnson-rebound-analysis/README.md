# Cam Johnson: Second-Half Rebound (2025–26)
## Overview
This report analyzes Cam Johnson’s performance during the 2025–26 NBA season, with a focus on whether his improved production in the latter half of the season reflects sustainable change or short-term variance. After an inconsistent start in a reduced offensive role, Johnson has delivered a strong recent stretch marked by improved efficiency, increased minutes, and clearer offensive rhythm within Denver’s system.

The analysis evaluates how Johnson’s shot profile, usage, and rebounding have evolved over time—and whether those changes reflect meaningful adjustment rather than a temporary shooting spike.

## Key Questions
The report is structured around three core questions:
* Is Johnson’s recent improvement sustained or driven by short-run variance?
* Has his role changed, or are improved outcomes coming from the same usage profile?
* Where on the floor are the gains coming from, particularly as a three-point shooter?

# Data Sources
The analysis integrates multiple NBA data endpoints:
* NBA Stats API (via hoopR)
  * League game logs
  * ShotChartDetail
* Derived metrics
  * Rolling averages
  * Usage-event proxies (FGA, FTA, TOV per 36)

All data reflects the 2025–26 regular season.

# Key Takeaways
* Johnson’s offensive role has remained largely stable; improvements are driven by execution, not usage expansion.
* Three-point attempt share normalized after early volatility, contributing to steadier efficiency.
* Gains are evident both from above the break and the corners without a structural change in shot location.
* Increased minutes amplified the impact of improved efficiency, leading to stronger counting production.
* The recent stretch reflects a sustained adjustment, not a one-week shooting spike.
