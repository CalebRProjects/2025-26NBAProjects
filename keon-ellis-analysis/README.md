# Keon Ellis Analysis
This project presents an in-depth analytical breakdown of Keon Ellis, focusing on why teams value him despite mediocre box-score production. The analysis emphasizes impact metrics, offensive role efficiency, defensive event creation, and overall versatility.

The goal is to evaluate Ellis as a **playoff-viable rotation guard** whose value is driven by defense, efficiency, and connectivity rather than usage or shot volume.

## Key Questions Addressed

- Why do lineups consistently perform better with Ellis on the floor?
- How does Ellis contribute offensively without requiring usage or touches?
- What makes his defensive impact translate across roles and lineups?
- Which team contexts maximize his value?
