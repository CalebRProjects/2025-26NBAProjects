# Overview
This report analyzes Neemias Queta’s performance during the 2025–26 NBA season, focusing on how his skill set scales under increased responsibility with the Boston Celtics. After operating in limited minutes during prior seasons, Queta was elevated into a consistent rotation and starting role amid frontcourt turnover. The analysis evaluates whether his production, efficiency, and impact hold up at starter-level usage.

The goal of this report is to assess whether Queta provides reliable, winning value within Boston’s ecosystem—and whether that value remains intact as minutes, matchup difficulty, and responsibility increase.

# Key Questions
The report is structured around three primary questions:
* Does Queta’s on-court impact scale with increased minutes?
* How does his offensive role as a play finisher translate to efficiency at volume?
* What type of defensive value does he provide, and where are its limits?

# Data Sources
The analysis integrates multiple data sources to evaluate Queta’s impact from different angles:
* NBA Stats (via hoopR)
  * Game-level on/off data
  * Rim defense tracking
  * Traditional and advanced box score metrics

*  Synergy / SportsRadar
  * Offensive play type usage and efficiency

* Databallr
  * WOWY lineup splits (low leverage removed)

* CraftedNBA
  * Defensive impact metrics and percentiles

All data reflects the 2025–26 regular season.

# Key Takeaways
* Queta’s impact scales cleanly with minutes; increased playing time does not introduce defensive slippage or lineup stress.
* Offensively, he provides strong value as a play finisher, converting advantages without requiring self-creation.
* Defensively, his value is concentrated at the rim, where he contests high volume and suppresses efficiency.
* His profile fits Boston’s ecosystem: reliable, low-usage offense paired with rim protection and physicality.
* Whether starting or in a reduced role, Queta profiles as a dependable rotation center, not a stopgap solution.
