# Overview
This short report analyzes an unusual statistical tendency in Jaren Jackson Jr.’s game: the frequency with which he records more combined steals and blocks (“stocks”) than total rebounds in a game. The idea was inspired by a discussion on the Numbers On The Board podcast and serves as a lens to highlight the unique trade-offs in Jackson’s defensive profile.

Jaren Jackson Jr. is an elite defensive playmaker, particularly as a shot blocker and event generator, but has long been a subpar rebounder for his position. By isolating games where his stocks exceed his rebounds, the analysis captures how often his defensive impact manifests through disruption rather than possession-ending rebounding.

# Purpose
The goal of this analysis is not to argue that stocks are more valuable than rebounds, nor to suggest that rebounding deficiencies are irrelevant. Instead, it aims to contextualize Jackson’s defensive value by showing how frequently his impact shows up in events rather than control of the glass, and how that pattern has persisted across seasons and postseason play.

# Method & Data
* Game logs were pulled across all regular seasons and playoffs in Jackson’s career (via hoopR).
* For each game, total steals and blocks were summed into a single “stocks” metric.
* Games where STL + BLK > REB were isolated and analyzed by season and game context.
* Summary tables and full game logs were produced for transparency and reproducibility.

# Why This Matters
For most bigs, games with more stocks than rebounds are rare outliers. For Jaren Jackson Jr., they occur with enough frequency to be descriptive rather than anecdotal. This pattern reinforces the idea that his defensive value is built around rim deterrence, shot blocking, and disruption—often at the expense of rebounding positioning.

Understanding this trade-off helps frame roster construction and scheme decisions around him. Jackson’s teams must account for his rebounding limitations while maximizing the defensive upside created by his event generation.
