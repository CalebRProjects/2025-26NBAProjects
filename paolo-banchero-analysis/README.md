# Overview
This report examines Paolo Banchero’s offensive profile during the 2025–26 NBA season, with a specific focus on shot selection, efficiency, play type usage, and lineup-level impact. While Banchero remains one of the league’s most physically gifted young forwards, the analysis evaluates whether his current offensive role maximizes those strengths within Orlando’s evolving offensive ecosystem.

The goal of the project is not to question Banchero’s talent or long-term ceiling, but to identify where his shot diet and usage patterns create inefficiencies and how reallocating those possessions could raise both his individual impact and the Magic’s offensive ceiling.

# Key Questions
This report is structured around three central questions:
* What shots does Paolo Banchero take, and how efficient are they by type and distance?
* How does his efficiency scale relative to his offensive volume and role?
* How do lineups featuring Banchero perform compared to those built around Franz Wagner?

# Data Sources
The analysis integrates data from multiple public and proprietary sources:
* NBA Stats API (via hoopR)
  * ShotChartDetail
  * Player and lineup dashboards

* Synergy / SportsRadar
  * Play type usage and efficiency

* Cleaning the Glass
  * Offensive overview metrics
  * On/off and Four Factors deltas

* Databallr
  * WOWY lineup splits (low leverage removed)

* CraftedNBA
  * Defensive impact metrics and percentiles

All data is contextualized within the 2025–26 regular season.

# Key Takeaways
* Banchero’s inefficiency is driven primarily by shot allocation, not lack of ability.
* His most efficient scoring avenues -- rim pressure, transition, and play-finishing -- represent a smaller share of his offensive usage than lower-efficiency self-created jump shots.
* Orlando’s offense can function around these inefficiencies, but doing so introduces a real opportunity cost in high-leverage possessions.
* Defensive impact is role-specific and concentrated, providing value near the rim but not enough to offset offensive inefficiencies.
* Optimizing Banchero’s role does not require reducing his importance -- only reallocating how his possessions are used.
