This project identifies NBA players who rebounded after poor early-season performance using a transparent, repeatable flagging system. Players are flagged based on early- versus recent-season changes in scoring efficiency and production.

The analysis is delivered via an R Markdown report with player-level summaries, comparative visuals, and interpretations to distinguish real improvement from variance-driven rebounds.
