This repository contains a collection of in-season NBA analytics projects. Each project is built with reproducible workflows and designed for both technical review and storytelling.

Current projects include:

Rebound After Slow Starts: A flagging and diagnostics framework identifying players who recovered from poor early-season performance and analyzing whether improvements stemmed from role changes, shot diet adjustments, or shooting regression.

Additional projects will be added throughout the season.

Tools: R
Data: NBA game logs and publicly available play-type data
