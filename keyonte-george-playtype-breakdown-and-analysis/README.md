# Keyonte George: 2025–26 Scoring Leap & Play-Type Profile
## Overview
This report evaluates Keyonte George’s 2025–26 scoring leap through two lenses: play-type usage/efficiency and on/off impact. It combines season-over-season production context with Synergy-style play-type breakdowns to identify where George’s value is being created, how repeatable it looks at volume, and what is holding his overall impact back.

# Key Questions
* Where is George getting his offense from by play type and frequency?
* Which play types are driving his efficiency and which are “engine reps” that carry the workload?
* How does Utah perform with George on the floor vs off the floor, and what side of the ball drives the split?

# Data Sources
* Synergy / SportsRadar
  * Possessions, % time, PPP, shot splits, turnover and free-throw indicators
* Databallr WOWY (team on/off splits)
  * OFF/DEF rating, team TS%, turnover, offensive rebounding, opponent equivalents

# Key Takeaways
* George’s leap is supported by real play-type structure: PnR Ball Handler volume drives the engine, with meaningful contributions from Transition, Spot Up, and Isolation.
* His most efficient pockets come from Spot Ups (high value, scalable) and Cuts (small volume, elite efficiency).
* The on/off profile is a tradeoff:
  * Utah’s offense improves substantially with George on the floor.
  * Utah’s defense worsens at a similar magnitude, leaving net impact near neutral in this lens.
* The swing factor is defensive context: lineup insulation, scheme support, and personnel fit determine whether the offensive jump translates into winning impact.
