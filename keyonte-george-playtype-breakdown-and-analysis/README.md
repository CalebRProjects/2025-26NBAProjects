This project analyzes Keyonte George’s 2025–26 NBA season to evaluate the legitimacy of his scoring leap, contextualize his offensive role, and assess the tradeoffs revealed by play-type data and on/off impact metrics.

The analysis combines counting stats, play-type efficiency, and on/off context to separate sustainable growth from noise, with an emphasis on how George scores, where the value comes from, and what limits his overall impact.

Data Sources
* Play-type data: Synergy / SportsRadar
* On/Off metrics: Databallr WOWY (low-leverage possessions removed)
* Counting stats: Season-level NBA statistics (nba.com)
